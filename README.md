## üí° Key Features

* **Semantic Search:** Utilizes `sentence-transformers` to understand the contextual similarity between resumes and job descriptions, providing a more accurate match score than traditional keyword search.
* **Ranked HR Dashboard:** Upload a single job description and multiple resumes to receive an instantly ranked dashboard of the best-fit candidates.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Doesn't just provide a score, but explains *why* a candidate is a good match by performing a detailed skill-gap analysis.
* **Side-by-Side Skill Comparison:** A visual UI that highlights matching skills (‚úÖ) and missing skills (‚ùå) for quick and easy evaluation.
* **Achievement Extraction:** Automatically identifies and extracts quantifiable achievements (e.g., "Increased sales by 20%") from resumes to give a deeper insight into a candidate's impact.
